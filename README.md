# Facial-Expression-Recognition-using-Keras
Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions and deployed the trained models onto a web interface using Flask.

The various tasks completed in this project include:
Task 1: Introduction and Overview
Task 2 : Explore the Dataset
Task 3: Generate Training and Validation Batches
Task 4: Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
Task 5: Train and Evaluate Model
Task 6: Represent Model as JSON String
Task 7: Create a Flask App to Serve Predictions
Task 8: Design an HTML Template for the Flask App
Task 9: Use Model to Recognize Facial Expressions in Videos

Technology used: Python3, Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Flask, HTML
